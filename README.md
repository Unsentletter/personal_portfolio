**Site Audience**

My sites audience is potential employers, and potential clients.  This site is a vehicle for me to show them what I can do, and give them easy access to sites I have created so they can see it wasn’t just first time lucky.


**Design Decisions**

*	I wanted to keep my design simple.  I am always more drawn to sites that have a clean and minimalist design.
*	One of the requirements of this project was that it show my personality.  As well as being simple, I wanted to show my love for the ocean.  To show that love I decided a simple photo of sunlight shining through the upper layers of the ocean for my landing page, and the light blue colour used both behind that (in case the photo doesn’t load) and the about me section lower down the page.
*	The image on the landing page is set so it takes up the full screen of any device.  I also used only my name, and a simple tag line to keep the first image as simple as possible.  My name and the tag line scale to the device screen as well and remain on only two lines to maintain the look across devices.
*	On the advice of Andres I added a 1px shadow to my name.  This resulted in me being beyond impressed.  It makes the words much sharper and look far more professional.
*	I used to parallax effect as the viewer scrolls down from the initial screen.  I chose to use this because I think it gives the page a professional looking edge, and makes it a little bit more than a single page website.
*	When I eventually have some projects to show I will have screenshots as links that will span the entire page and be about 5 cms high.  These screenshots will be in the ‘Cool Stuff I Have Done’ section of my page.  I have left this section white to contrast the colours of the website and not take any attention away from them.  I want them to be the most important and attention grabbing part of my site.
*	The next section is my 'About Me’ section.  I have split it in half.  The left half is a photo of me, the right half is a short paragraph about me.  This keeps the photo of me from having to be too large, and also keeps the written section in an enticing format.  I feel that people are much more likely to read something when it is not a full page, and is sort of compressed.  It is much more appealing to the eye.
*	I included a photo of myself so potential employers and clients can see how really ridiculously good looking I am.  I think it also shows the potential employer/client that I scrub up pretty well and am someone that working beside would be enjoyable.
*	In the written section of my ‘About Me’ I tried to show my personality which is a constant balancing act of being serious, and being silly.  I think I nailed it pretty well.  I managed to include my interests, my work history, why I love coding, and a few silly lines in a short paragraph
*	I decided on the colour black for my footer to provide a contrast to the rest of the site.  There is a lot of white and light colours, and I think the black makes them stand out a lot more.  It also means I had to change the colour of the text in the footer.  This makes it stand out from the rest of the text.  My email, and other contact details are included here, so the viewer will not miss these and will know how to contact me and hire me after they tell me just how much they love my work.
*	I used Bootstrap and Font-awesome for the icons for my email and social networks, and put an animation on them that changes to the colour of the network when the mouse hovers over it.  This adds a bit of colour to the black footer and makes them stand out a little bit without being over powering.
*	I used both an email icon, and my email address to link to my enquiry form.  I did this because of my personal preference (and I have since found out the preference of a number of my mates).  If I am going to send an email to someone I prefer to get the email address from the website and copy it to my email and send the email from there, rather than complete the form provided.  I decided to cater for both options.
*	I continued my use of the light blue as the background of my form to continue the theme from the rest of the website.  I also think that having a coloured background allows the actual form fields to stand out in a really satisfying way.
*	I decided to scale my site for mobile for two reasons.  One being that it made my life easier, but I also think that keeping the site as close as possible across devices makes the user feel more comfortable if they are accessing on a range of devices.


**Usability**

*User Control and freedom*
*	My form has an option to edit what the user submits allowing them to correct any mistakes they may have made when they initially submitted the form.

*Consistency and Standards*
*	I used the vh & vw values to maintain consistency across browsers and devices.  Using these values and setting them at 100 means that the parts of my site that are wrapped in these values will scale when the screen is smaller or larger.  This means that, no matter what device my site is viewed on it will look largely the same and make it easy for the viewer to view, and find things they are looking for if they have previously visited my site on a different device.

*Aesthetic and minimal design*
*	Apart from the form, the site is a single page.  All the information is easily accessible.  My font and colours are maintained throughout the entire design, and where there is text I have kept it short and to the point.
*	Due to the simplicity of my design, the required amount of CSS/HTML is minimal.  This means there is less chance of my site loading incorrectly, or having problems when a viewer is using it.
